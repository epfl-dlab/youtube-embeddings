# Generating embeddings

This folder contains all the notebooks for generating the various embeddings. Please note that not all of the data is available from this repository (the most important ones being the pushshift dumps).

All embeddings are based on the reddit one, meaning that we only created embeddings for channels which were quite large and mentionned on reddit.

The diagram below explains more in detail what notebooks are used for which task:
